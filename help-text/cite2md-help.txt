cite2md — resolve citations/keys to Markdown fulltext

Usage:
  cite2md [--cat] [citation-or-key ...]
  cite2md [--cat]               # read newline-delimited keys from stdin

Inputs accepted:
  - LaTeX-style citations (e.g. \citet{vesper:2012_jumping})
  - BibTeX keys with colons (e.g. vesper:2012_jumping)
  - Normalized keys without colons (e.g. vesper2012_jumping)

Output:
  - default: print an absolute Markdown path for each resolved key
  - --cat: stream the Markdown contents to stdout, concatenated

Exit codes:
  - 0 at least one key resolved
  - 1 inputs processed but nothing resolved
  - 2 usage error (e.g. missing input, invalid flag)

Examples (list → then read one):
  # From a draft → keys → read first key
  draft2keys draft.md > keys.txt
  key=$(sed -n '1p' keys.txt)
  cite2md --cat "$key"
  
  # Path-only, then search in that file
  p=$(cite2md vesper:2012_jumping)
  rg -n "joint outcome" "$p"

Notes:
  - Accepts newline-delimited keys on stdin when called without arguments.
  - Logs unresolved keys to missing-fulltext.txt in the current working directory.
