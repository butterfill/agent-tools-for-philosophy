cat-sources — print Markdown fulltext for selected paths

Usage:
  cat-sources [paths...]
  cat-sources               # read newline-delimited paths from stdin

Environment:
  - PAPERS_DIR (default: $HOME/papers) — root directory for allowed paths

Behavior:
  - Rejects absolute and parent-directory references to keep reads inside PAPERS_DIR
  - Skips blank lines and comments (# ...) when reading from stdin
  - Exits 1 if nothing is printed; exits 2 on invalid input or rejected paths

Dependencies:
  - coreutils cat (available on all supported platforms)

Workflow tips:
  - Pipe fd-sources or rg-sources results directly into cat-sources for quick reading.
  - Maintain curated reading lists by storing relative paths in a text file and feeding them via stdin.
  - Combine with cite2md to jump from citation keys to Markdown content in one step.

Examples (list → then read one):
  p=$(fd-sources vesper2012_jumping | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"
  p=$(rg-sources -l 'bayesian prior' | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"
  cite2md --cat vesper:2012_jumping
