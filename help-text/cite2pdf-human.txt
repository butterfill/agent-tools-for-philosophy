cite2pdf — resolve citations/keys to PDF fulltext

Usage:
  cite2pdf [citation-or-key ...]
  cite2pdf                     # read newline-delimited keys from stdin

Inputs:
  - LaTeX citations (e.g. \citet{key})
  - BibTeX keys with colons (author:year_topic)
  - Normalized keys without colons (author2020_topic)

Environment:
  - PAPERS_DIR (default: $HOME/papers) — root directory for stored PDFs

Resolution strategy:
  1) Use fd to locate <normalized-key>.pdf under PAPERS_DIR.
  2) If no PDF is found, call cite2md to resolve the Markdown path and swap the extension to .pdf when present.

Output:
  - default: print absolute PDF paths, one per resolved key
  - --open: print and launch the system PDF viewer (xdg-open, open, start)
  - --reveal: print and reveal the containing directory (Finder or xdg-open)

Dependencies:
  - fd, cite2md, sed, jq (via cite2md), xdg-open/open/start for viewer actions

Workflow tips:
  - Pair with draft2keys when fact-checking a draft that cites multiple papers.
  - Pipe the output into xargs open/xdg-open when you want to review several PDFs manually.
  - Coordinate with cite2md to verify that Markdown and PDF copies stay in sync.

Examples (list → then read one):
  # From a draft → keys → open the first PDF
  draft2keys draft.md > keys.txt
  key=$(sed -n '1p' keys.txt)
  cite2pdf --open "$key"
  
  # Path-only, keep for later
  cite2pdf vesper:2012_jumping > vesper.pdf.path
