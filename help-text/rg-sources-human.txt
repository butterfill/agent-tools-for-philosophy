rg-sources — run ripgrep against Markdown fulltext

Usage:
  rg-sources [rg-flags...] [--] [pattern] [paths...]

Environment:
  - PAPERS_DIR (default: $HOME/papers) — search root

Behavior:
  - Forces Markdown scope by injecting ripgrep type filters for .md/.mdx
  - Rejects absolute or parent-directory paths (before and after --)
  - Disallows ripgrep type/glob overrides to keep searches within Markdown sources

Dependencies:
  - ripgrep (rg)

Workflow tips:
  - Capture relative matches with -l, then pipe to cat-sources for reading.
  - Store hits in a file and inspect the first one: rg-sources -l ... > hits.txt; sed -n '1p' hits.txt | cat-sources
  - Combine with cite2md when you need both context and file locations for specific citations.

Examples (list → then read one):
  rg-sources -n "bayesian prior"
  rg-sources -i -C1 "causal"
  rg-sources -l -i "causal effect" > hits.txt
  p=$(sed -n '1p' hits.txt); cat-sources "$p"
