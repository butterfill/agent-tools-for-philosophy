fd-sources — run fd against Markdown source filenames

Usage:
  fd-sources [fd-flags...] [--] [pattern] [paths...]

Behavior:
  - Rejects absolute paths and parent-directory references
  - Blocks fd extension overrides; use fd directly for other formats

Exit codes:
  - Mirrors fd’s status (0 match found, 1 no matches, >1 error)

Examples (list → then read one):
  fd-sources vesper2012_jumping
  fd-sources -i 'vesper.*jump'
  fd-sources -i 'butterfill.*2019'
  p=$(fd-sources vesper2012_jumping | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"

Notes:
  - Works well in tandem with cat-sources to inspect files immediately.
