cat-sources — print Markdown fulltext for selected paths

Usage:
  cat-sources [paths...]
  cat-sources               # read newline-delimited paths from stdin

Behavior:
  - Reads relative paths under PAPERS_DIR; rejects absolute or parent-directory inputs
  - Reads from stdin when no positional paths are supplied (skips blank lines and comments)
  - Exits 1 if nothing was printed; exits 2 on invalid input

Examples (list → then read one):
  p=$(fd-sources vesper2012_jumping | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"
  p=$(rg-sources -l 'bayesian prior' | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"
  cite2md --cat vesper:2012_jumping

Notes:
  - Ideal for streaming files discovered via fd-sources or rg-sources.
  - Keeps stdout free of extra logging, making it safe to pipe into viewers.
