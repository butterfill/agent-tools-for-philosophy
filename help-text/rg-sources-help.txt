rg-sources — run ripgrep against Markdown fulltext

Usage:
  rg-sources [rg-flags...] [--] [pattern] [paths...]

Behavior:
  - Restricts searches to Markdown files located under PAPERS_DIR
  - Rejects absolute paths and parent-directory references in positional arguments
  - Blocks ripgrep type/glob overrides (-t/-T/--glob/--iglob/--type-*)

Exit codes:
  - Mirrors ripgrep’s status (0 match found, 1 no matches, >1 error)

Examples (list → then read one):
  rg-sources -n "bayesian prior"
  rg-sources -i -C1 "causal"
  rg-sources -l -i "causal effect" > hits.txt
  p=$(sed -n '1p' hits.txt); cat-sources "$p"

Notes:
  - Pair with cat-sources to stream the matching Markdown content.
  - Use -l to capture relative paths for downstream tooling.
