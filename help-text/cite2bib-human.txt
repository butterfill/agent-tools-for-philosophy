cite2bib — resolve citations/keys to BibTeX entries

Usage:
  cite2bib <citation-or-key>

Inputs:
  - LaTeX citations such as \citet{key}
  - BibTeX keys with colons (author:year_topic)
  - Normalized keys with colons removed (author2020_topic)

Environment:
  - BIB_FILE (default: $HOME/endnote/phd_biblio.bib) — BibTeX library consulted on lookup
  - missing-keys.txt is appended in the current working directory when lookups fail

Resolution strategy:
  1) ripgrep for an exact key match (^@type{key,) in BIB_FILE.
  2) Strip colons from the requested key and rescan with awk/gawk for normalized matches.

Output:
  - Print the matched BibTeX entry to stdout on success

Dependencies:
  - ripgrep (rg), awk/gawk, sed

Workflow tips:
  - Use find-bib to shortlist candidate keys before calling cite2bib.
  - Pipe cite2bib output into rg '^@' to confirm the entry header quickly.
  - Redirect the output to create ad-hoc .bib snippets for sharing.

Examples (list → then read one):
  find-bib --author vesper --year 2013 --title jump > keys.txt
  key=$(sed -n '1p' keys.txt)
  cite2bib "$key" | rg '^@'
  cite2bib vesper2012_jumping > vesper.bib
