cite2md — resolve citations/keys to Markdown fulltext

Usage:
  cite2md [--cat] [citation-or-key ...]
  cite2md [--cat]               # read newline-delimited keys from stdin

Inputs:
  - LaTeX citations such as \citet{key}, \citep{key}, etc.
  - BibTeX keys with colons (author:year_topic)
  - Normalized keys with colons stripped (author2020_topic)

Environment:
  - PAPERS_DIR (default: $HOME/papers) — root directory for Markdown fulltext
  - INDEX_FILE (default: $PAPERS_DIR/bibtex-index.jsonl) — optional lookup index
  - missing-fulltext.txt is appended in the current working directory on misses

Resolution strategy:
  1) Locate <normalized-key>.md under PAPERS_DIR via fd.
  2) Fall back to INDEX_FILE (matching .key or colon-stripped variants) to recover the relative path.

Output modes:
  - default: print absolute Markdown paths (one per resolved key)
  - --cat: stream Markdown contents to stdout (keys concatenated in order)

Dependencies:
  - fd, jq, sed, awk

Human shortcuts:
  --vs / --vsi   Open the resolved path in VS Code / VS Code Insiders
  --reveal       Reveal the resolved path in Finder (macOS) or open the directory via xdg-open

Workflow tips:
  - Use draft2keys to pull citation keys from a draft, then pipe into cite2md.
  - Pipe cite2md output into rg-sources or cat-sources for focused reading.
  - Combine with cite2pdf when you need both Markdown and PDF versions of a source.

Examples (list → then read one):
  # From a draft → keys → read first key
  draft2keys draft.md > keys.txt
  key=$(sed -n '1p' keys.txt)
  cite2md --cat "$key"
  
  # Path-only, then search in that file
  p=$(cite2md vesper:2012_jumping)
  rg -n "joint outcome" "$p"
