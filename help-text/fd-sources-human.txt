fd-sources — run fd against Markdown source filenames

Usage:
  fd-sources [fd-flags...] [--] [pattern] [paths...]

Environment:
  - PAPERS_DIR (default: $HOME/papers) — search root

Behavior:
  - Forces fd to limit results to Markdown (.md, .mdx) under PAPERS_DIR
  - Rejects absolute paths and parent-directory references to keep scope safe
  - Blocks extension overrides (-e/--extension) so users stay within Markdown

Dependencies:
  - fd

Workflow tips:
  - Pipe results directly into cat-sources: fd-sources key | cat-sources
  - Combine with rg-sources when toggling between filename- and content-based searches.
  - Capture the first hit for follow-up: p=$(fd-sources pattern | sed -n '1p'); cite2md "$p"

Examples (list → then read one):
  fd-sources vesper2012_jumping
  fd-sources -i 'vesper.*jump'
  fd-sources -i 'butterfill.*2019'
  p=$(fd-sources vesper2012_jumping | sed -n '1p'); cat-sources "$p"
