cite2pdf — resolve citations/keys to PDF fulltext

Usage:
  cite2pdf [citation-or-key ...]
  cite2pdf                     # read newline-delimited keys from stdin

Inputs accepted:
  - LaTeX-style citations (e.g. \citet{vesper:2012_jumping})
  - BibTeX keys with colons (vesper:2012_jumping)
  - Normalized keys without colons (vesper2012_jumping)

Output:
  - default: print absolute PDF paths for each resolved key (one per line)
  - --open / --reveal: also launch the system viewer or reveal the file after printing

Exit codes:
  - 0 at least one PDF resolved (even if an opener action failed)
  - 1 inputs processed but no PDFs resolved
  - 2 usage error (e.g. invalid flag, missing input)

Examples (list → then read one):
  # From a draft → keys → open the first PDF
  draft2keys draft.md > keys.txt
  key=$(sed -n '1p' keys.txt)
  cite2pdf --open "$key"
  
  # Path-only, keep for later
  cite2pdf vesper:2012_jumping > vesper.pdf.path

Notes:
  - Accepts newline-delimited keys on stdin when called without arguments.
