\chapter{Preface}

‘Daddy, what are you writing a book about?’

‘I’m writing about how humans go from knowing nothing---like [our baby] Lucas---to
knowing lots of things about physical objects and minds and colours
and actions, like you do.’

‘Is it a chapter book?’

‘Yes, it’s a chapter book.’

‘Do you know what I think?’

‘What do you think my love?’

‘I think … I think when you get older you know more things and you get
them in your brain.’

‘Hmm, maybe.’

‘Well, I’m not sure.  But that’s what I think.  Maybe not.’

‘OK.’

‘Now you have to write it.  Are you going to write what I think?’

‘OK, look I’m writing it’

‘Can you come now daddy?’

‘Just let me write a bit more.’

‘Daddy, what shall we write next?’
