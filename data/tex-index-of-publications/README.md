I got rovodev to create this index following the instructions in `task-create-tex-index-of-my-publications.md`. Of course we do not have tex sources for all publications.

With the index, you can use `copy_tex_sources.py` to create a folder called `tex-sources` with the .tex sources in it.
Then copy this `tex-sources/` folder to `~/syncthing/papers` so that it is where the tools will look for it.
